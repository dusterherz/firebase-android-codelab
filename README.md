# Firebase Android Codelab
A little repository to make the Codelab for Firebase on Android

# Why this on GitHub ?

I like to have a clean project and to work by functionnality. It can also serve to show that I have made the Codelab tutorial. Also, I work with two computers (one at work and one at home), and it's more easy to share files this way.

# Why Firebase ?

All my collegues talk everyday of it. I needed a little API for an Android app, so I'm here today !

# How far I am ?

I've finished the tutorial. Now, I'm starting my own app with it !
